           PhD from UPC in 2010. After finishing the PhD, he spent 15 months at
           the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI), affiliated with
           UC Berkeley, as a Fulbright Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Holder
           during 2011 and 2012. In 2013, he returned to Barcelona to work on
           multiple European projects (RoMoL, Mont-Blanc, EPI, DeepHealth,
           eProcessor) and industrial projects (Arm, IBM, Lenovo). Miquel has
           published over 125-refereed conference and journal papers and
           co-advised 12 PhD students. In 2019, he led the design and
           fabrication of Lagarto, the first academic processor developed in
           Spain based on the open source RISC-V instruction set architecture.
           Finally, he coordinates the DRAC project, which is promoting the
           Lagarto initiative with new generations of the processor and
           accelerators.
