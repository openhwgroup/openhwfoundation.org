_Group Announces RISC-V-based CORE-V MCU Development Kit for IoT Built with Open-Source Hardware & Software_

OTTAWA, Canada – July 10, 2022 - [OpenHW Group](http://www.openhwgroup.org/) today announced that it 
will showcase one of the industry’s most comprehensive open-source RISC-V development kits 
for attendees at the [59th Design Automation Conference](http://www.dac.com/) in San 
Francisco this week. 

Featuring the [OpenHW CORE-V MCU](https://www.openhwgroup.org/core-v-devkits/), the CORE-V software developer kit (SDK) with full-featured 
Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE,) and an open printed circuit board (PCB) 
design were unveiled at [Embedded World in Nuremberg](https://www.openhwgroup.org/news/2022/06/20/openhw-group-announces-risc-v-based-core-v-mcu-development-kit-for-iot-built-with-open-source-hardware-software/) in June 2022, generating tremendous 
developer buzz. The CORE-V MCU is based on the open-source CV32E40P embedded-class 
processor, a small, efficient, 32-bit, in-order open-source RISC-V core with a four-stage 
pipeline that implements the RV32IM[F]C RISC-V instruction extensions.

The ground-breaking open-source RISC-V processor  CORE-V MCU DevKit enables software 
development for embedded, internet-of-things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven 
applications. It also supports Amazon Web Services (AWS) via AWS IoT ExpressLink. AWS IoT 
ExpressLink is a new service that powers a range of hardware modules and includes 
AWS-validated software that securely connects devices to the cloud. 

“The OpenHW community is really excited to be able to share this open-source innovation with 
one of the most influential audiences in the industry at DAC this week,” said Rick O’Connor, 
President and CEO, OpenHW Group. “We’re helping the world rethink how designs for IoT 
applications come to market. The open-source OpenHW ecosystem is delivering hardware, 
software and development tools to accelerate innovation across the industry. It’s inspiring 
and humbling to watch the global collaborative engineering effort that’s gotten us to this 
point.”

The OpenHW Group is a non-profit, global organization driven by its members and individual 
contributors, where hardware and software designers collaborate in the development of 
open-source cores and related IP tools and software. OpenHW Group and members will demo the 
OpenHW CORE-V MCU DevKit for Cloud Connected IoT at DAC in San Francisco, July 11-13 at the 
Moscone West Convention Center in booth #2340.

OpenHW Group and members will showcase the CORE-V MCU devkit emulating an array of weather 
station sensors located in various locations around the world. The demo, involving more than
a dozen DevKits, will showcase the CORE-V MCU, CORE-V SDK, and interconnection of IoT 
sensors and application to AWS, with local temperature readings on the CORE-V MCU NexysA7 
board. 

The CORE-V SDK, development of which was led by the Ashling, contains an IDE, Debugger, GCC compiler 
(supplied by Embecosm), the FreeRTOS real-time OS, and AWS IoT ExpressLink connectivity, using 
Espressif’s RISC-V-based WiFi radio over AWS IoT ExpressLink. This project highlights the open-source 
collaborative development of industry-grade CORE-V processor IP with supporting hardware and software 
by a wide spectrum of members within the OpenHW community.

The CORE-V MCU DevKit early access campaign manufacturing and shipping is being coordinated by 
GroupGets. Early access CORE-V MCU DevKit quantities are limited and can be 
[reserved here](https://groupgets.com/campaigns/1040-core-v-mcu-devkit).

## About OpenHW Group and CORE-V Family

The charter of the OpenHW Group is to develop, verify and provide open-source processor cores, along 
with hardware and software needed for use in high volume SoC production. OpenHW provides an 
infrastructure for hosting high quality open-source HW developments in line with industry best 
practices. The OpenHW Cores Task Group within the organization has the mandate to develop the 
open-source IP for the CORE-V family of open-source RISC-V processors. The OpenHW Group is a global, 
non-profit, member-driven organization based in Canada, and partnered with the Eclipse Foundation.
