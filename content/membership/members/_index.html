    The following are the members of the OpenHW Foundation. This list does not
    include members of the original OpenHW Group that are in the process of
    migrating their membership to the new OpenHW Foundation. As members complete
    the migration process, their logos will be added here.

    Please visit the <a href="/membership/become-a-member/#">Become a Member</a> 
    page and contact us if you have questions or wish to complete the migration
    for your company.
