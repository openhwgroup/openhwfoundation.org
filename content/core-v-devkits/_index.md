# CORE-V DevKits

Welcome to the OpenHW Group CORE-V DevKits page.

CORE-V DevKits that support evaluation of and development for OpenHW SoCs are developed by the OpenHW Hardware Task Group and the OpenHW Software Task Group contributing members.

Available CORE-V DevKits are listed below.

## CORE-V MCU Emulation Platform

### Description

The [CORE-V MCU](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-mcu) emulation platform integrates the [CV32E40P Processor IP](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40p) using the PULPissimo SoC from the [PULP Platform](https://pulp-platform.org/) and the [Quicklogic ArticPro eFPGA](https://www.quicklogic.com/products/efpga/arcticpro/). The CORE-V-MCU has been implemented on the Nexys A7 FPGA platform to support evaluation of processor functionality and software development using the [CORE-V SDK](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-sdk).

To get started with the CORE-V-MCU, consult the [CORE-V-MCU Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-mcu/blob/master/emulation/quickstart/README.md) and the [CORE-V-SDK Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-sdk/blob/main/README.md)

CORE-V MCU DevKit

### Description

The [CORE-V MCU DevKit](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-mcu-devkit) is a turnkey development and prototyping platform for the CORE-V-MCU System on Chip. The CORE-V MCU DevKit enables makers of IoT and embedded systems to evaluate the performance of the CORE-V MCU, to interface with peripherals, and to develop and test software using the [CORE-V SDK](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-sdk).

The CORE-V MCU DevKit includes these features

- CORE-V MCU
  - CV32E40P processor core
  - Quicklogic ArticPro eFPGA
- Ashling Opella-LD onboard JTAG debug module
- USB-C for terminal and onboard debug access
- JTAG connector for external debug access
- Espressif AWS IoT ExpressLink Module for AWS IoT cloud interconnect
- mikroBUS onboard socket, allowing access to a vast range of [mikroBUS modules](https://www.mikroe.com/mikrobus)
- 40 pin expansion header
- I2C temperature sensor
- Assortment of LEDs
- Reset button and general purpose button
- Dimensions 75 mm x 100 mm
- Power supply via USB-C or barrel connector (5V - 18V in)

### Pre-ordering the CORE-V MCU DevKit

The CORE-V MCU DevKit will be available for order on the [GroupGets website](https://groupgets.com/) with anticipated delivery in Q1 2022. Visit the [GroupGets CORE-V MCU DevKit early access campaign page](https://groupgets.com/campaigns/1040-core-v-mcu-devkit) to reserve your DevKit, as early access quantities are limited.
