Do you like open-source HW RISC-V CPUs?

...and even more, do you like to have HIGH-QUALITY, VERIFIED, open-source HW IPs?

If the answer is YES, and you want to help us build them, this job offer is for you.

We are looking for a Hardware Verification Engineer that extends our ecosystem.

**You will:**

- Use SystemVerilog and UVM to create and extend our testbenches: you should know how to verify IPs with random instructions
- Use GitHub to integrate and maintain everything open-source on GitHub under core-v-verif
- Verify CPUs based on RISC-V
- Verify peripherals such as UART, SPI, GPIOs, interrupt controllers and interconnects
- Integrate and extend existing CPUs to support extra features
- Integrate and extend new co-processors
- Work fully remotely in a large and global team

**To accomplish the above missions, you should:**

- Be very confident with SystemVerilog and UVM for use with coverage-driven, constrained-random verification strategies.
- A working knowledge of:
    - Linux, Make and Python
    - Computer architectures of general-purpose CPUs
    - Peripheral busses, interrupt controllers and peripherals such as UART, SPI, GPIOs
- A commerical SystemVerilog simulator and associated debug and coverage tools
    - Familiarity with Formal Verification, RTL design, RISC-V ISA and Git would also be an asset

**Qualifications**

- A Bachelor's degree (or higher) in EE or CS with 5+ years of experience
- You must be resident in European Union, in particular in Italy, France, or Germany
