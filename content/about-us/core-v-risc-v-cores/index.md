The CORE-V series comprises a range of open source RISC-V cores, each equipped
with processor subsystem IP, tools, and softwareâ€“and all designed to accelerate
innovation in electronic systems. Optimized for both silicon and FPGA
applications, these cores facilitate streamlined design processes, resulting in
manufacturable, production-ready system-on-chips (SoCs) that are built for high
performance and reliability.

The CORE-V series offers a versatile range of RISC-V cores tailored to diverse
application requirements:

- CVA6: High-performance 64/32-bit cores ideal for Linux-based systems and
  safety-critical applications.
- CVW: CV-Wally a 64bit core based on a Textbook (fully architecture and design
  consideration documentation) verified to industrial ready level 
- CVE4: 32-bit embedded-class cores optimized for IoT, edge computing, and
  consumer electronics.
- CVE2: Ultra-efficient processors for deeply embedded control applications.
- CVA6 Platform: A vendor-neutral validation platform for various FPGA
  configurations, including AWS cloud solutions

Each core is purpose-built to meet specific performance and efficiency
standards, driving innovation across embedded and high-performance computing.
