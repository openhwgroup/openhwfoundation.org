## Statement of Work for OpenHW Europe WG HW Verification Engineer

The Eclipse Foundation Europe GmbH is hiring for its OpenHW Europe Working Group a HW Verification Engineer. Working as a member of the Eclipse Research Team, and working closely with the OpenHW Technical Working Group, the candidate will work to verify at industrial-grade open-source IPs based on RISC-V.

Through the OpenHW Europe Working Group, we are recruiting for the role of HW Verification Engineer that will primarily contribute to the TRISTAN project for the next 3 years. The TRISTAN (**T**ogether for **RIS**c-V **T**echnology and **A**pplicatio**N**s) project is a KDT-JU European Union-funded project that aims to expand, mature, and industrialize the European RISC-V ecosystem for the next generation of industrial hardware so that it is able to compete with existing commercial/proprietary alternatives. The project will address SW to EDA tools, all the way to RTL components, ensuring a complete stack based on RISC-V.TRISTAN  includes several work packages that will cover 1) requirements collections of the European market needs; 2) development of industrial-grade CPU and SoC building blocks; 3) software stacks; 4) and applications/demo development.

A major focus for TRISTAN is to provide European digital sovereignty and democratic access to most of the RISC-V IPs As such, a significant portion of the developed IP blocks under TRISTAN will be released as open-source IPs. 

The OpenHW Group ecosystem, and in particular, the OpenHW Europe Eclipse Foundation Working Group, provides industrial-grade open-source IPs verified to be compliant with a Technology Readiness Level greater than or equal to TRL5. 

We are looking for a Hardware Verification Engineer that extends the OpenHW Group ecosystem.

## In this role you will:

- Carrying out typical research tasks including dissemination, reporting, etc.
- Support the specific initiatives of the OpenHW Technical Working Group to drive interest, participation, and adoption beyond just the TRISTAN project
- Support the broader objectives of the EF's European research team, including
    - Lead the activities of the Eclipse Foundation to support the European research ecosystem, more specifically in the OpenHW Europe working group activities. 
    - Initiate and organize dissemination and community-building activities for the projects, leveraging existing Eclipse Foundation initiatives and assets
    - Facilitate project participation at events such as conferences to benefit the projects
    - Enable dissemination through web assets, newsletters and Eclipse-related social media
    - Complete regular reporting (workload and expenses) as required by the EU processes
    - Support research project developers in working with the Eclipse Development Process (EDP) and open source and open hardware best practices
    - Represent the Eclipse Foundation and OpenHW Europe working group at research project meetings and reviews
    - Encourage synergies among the EU projects and Eclipse Foundation members
- Use SystemVerilog and UVM to create and extend our testbenches: you should know how to verify IPs with random instructions
- Use GitHub to integrate and maintain everything open-source on GitHub under [core-v-verif](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif)
- Verify CPUs based on RISC-V
- Verify peripherals such as UART, SPI, GPIOs, interrupt controllers, and interconnects
- Integrate and extend existing CPUs to support extra features
- Integrate and extend new co-processors
- Work fully remotely in a large and global team

## To accomplish the mission above, you should:

- Be very confident with SystemVerilog and UVM for use with coverage-driven, constrained-random verification strategies.
- A working knowledge of:
    - Linux, Make, and Python
    - Computer architectures of general-purpose CPUs
    - Peripheral busses, interrupt controllers, and peripherals such as UART, SPI, and GPIOs
    - A commercial SystemVerilog simulator and associated debug and coverage tools
- Familiarity with Formal Verification, RTL design, RISC-V ISA, and Git would also be an asset

## Qualifications

- A Bachelor's degree (or higher) in EE or CS with 5+ years of experience
- Fluent in English (spoken and written)
- You must be a resident of Italy, France, Spain, or Germany
