Finding the path to amazing open-source innovation just got easier. That’s because Intel® Pathfinder for RISC-V has been launched, transforming the way SoC architects and system software developers define and design new products. Intel® Pathfinder allows for a variety of RISC-V cores and other IP to be instantiated on FPGAs and simulator platforms, with the ability to run industry-leading operating systems and tool chains within a unified IDE. Intel® Pathfinder not only saves time in assembling and testing different IP combinations in a single environment, but it also comes with robust software and industry standard toolchains that support seamless scaling for a broad spectrum of customers.

The Intel Pathfinder initiative simplifies the development of RISC-V-based systems that leverage both commercial and open-source processor cores such as the [OpenHW CORE-V Family](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-cores).  At launch, the Intel Pathfinder development suite includes support for the OpenHW CORE-V MCU and CVA6 projects. The [CORE-V MCU](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-mcu) is based on the open-source CV32E40P embedded-class processor, a small, efficient, 32-bit, in-order open-source RISC-V core with a four-stage pipeline that implements the RV32IM[F]C RISC-V instruction extensions.  The CORE-V CVA6 is a 6-stage, single issue, in-order CPU core which implements the 64-bit RISC-V instruction set. CVA6 fully implements the RISC-V I, M, A and C extensions as specified in Volume I: User-Level ISA V 2.3 as well as the draft privilege extension 1.10.

“The open-source OpenHW ecosystem along with Intel Pathfinder for RISC-V is proof of a global collaborative engineering effort that is accelerating a new frontier of innovation across the industry and leveraging open-source IP building blocks,” said Rick O’Connor, President, and CEO from OpenHW Group.

“Having support for the OpenHW CORE-V projects as we launch Intel® Pathfinder for RISC-V* reflects how Intel is accelerating the adoption of RISC-V by collaborating with the RISC-V ecosystem, said Vijay Krishnan, GM of the Intel Venture that launched Intel Pathfinder.  “Availability of the recently launched OpenHW CORE-V MCU and the CVA6 gives Intel® Pathfinder users easy access to open-source RISC-V IP targeting commercial developers.”

Developers looking to accelerate their open-source projects can leverage the OpenHW Group [CORE-V MCU DevKit](https://www.openhwgroup.org/core-v-devkits/).  The CORE-V MCU DevKit was recently showcased at Embedded World 2022 and DAC 2022, emulating an array of weather station sensors located in various locations around the world. The demo involved more than a dozen DevKits and highlighted the CORE-V MCU, CORE-V SDK, and interconnection of IoT sensors to AWS IoT Cloud with local temperature readings on the CORE-V MCU NexysA7 board. 

The CORE-V MCU project highlights the global open-source collaborative development of industry-grade CORE-V processor IP with supporting hardware and software by a wide spectrum of members within the OpenHW community and now also includes Intel Pathfinder for RISC-V.
