OTTAWA, Canada – August 16, 2023 - [OpenHW Group](/) today announced that the
industry's most comprehensive Development Kit for an open-source RISC-V MCU is
now available to be ordered.  The OpenHW CORE-V MCU DevKit includes an
open-source printed circuit board (PCB) which integrates OpenHW's CORE-V MCU
and various peripherals,  a software development kit (SDK) with a full-featured
Eclipse-based integrated development environment (IDE), as well as connectivity
to Amazon Web Services (AWS) via [AWS IoT ExpressLink](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-expresslink/) 
for secure and reliable connectivity between IoT devices and AWS cloud
services.

The comprehensive open-source CORE-V MCU DevKit enables software development
for embedded, internet-of-things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven
applications. The CORE-V MCU is based on the open-source CV32E40P
embedded-class processor, a small, efficient, 32-bit, in-order open-source
RISC-V core with a four-stage pipeline that implements the RV32IM[F]C RISC-V
instruction extensions.

"We're thrilled to announce the highly anticipated CORE-V MCU based on the
revolutionary RISC-V architecture, has successfully taped-out and the DevKit is
now available for ordering," said Rick O'Connor, President and CEO, OpenHW
Group. "The collaborative efforts of the open-source community have once again
proven their ability to drive innovation and deliver essential building blocks
for next-generation MCU designs."

The DevKit's SDK, developed by an OpenHW team led by
[Ashling](https://www.ashling.com/), contains an IDE, Debugger, GCC compiler
(supplied by Embecosm), [FreeRTOS real-time OS](https://www.freertos.org/index.html), 
and demo software. This project highlights the open-source collaborative
development of industry-grade CORE-V processor IP with supporting hardware and
software by a wide spectrum of members within the OpenHW community. Orders for
the CORE-V MCU DevKit [can be placed here](https://groupgets.com/campaigns/1040) 
from GroupGets.

The rapidly expanding OpenHW ecosystem rallied together to deliver the
innovative CORE-V DevKit for IoT developers:

- The CORE-V MCU is manufactured by [GlobalFoundries’](https://gf.com/)
  proprietary 22FDX® process technology platform that is well-suited for
  efficient single-chip integration of digital and analog signals, delivering
  cost-effective performance for connected and low-power embedded applications.
-	Design and verification of the CV32E40P processor, the heart of the CORE-V
  MCU, involved key contributions from [Imperas](https://www.imperas.com/), 
  [Siemens EDA](https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/), [SiLabs](https://www.silabs.com/applications/industrial-iot?s_kwcid=AL!16736!3!581604618843!!!g!!&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwxOymBhAFEiwAnodBLJZ_WUiuCpY_T7O3lVD0AcI3L6Sbn_VAWYBCz5FWLdpTzsULGS_V4RoC6NQQAvD_BwE) 
  and many others, building on the original design from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). 
  The CV32E40P core is based on the [PULP (Parallel Ultra Low Power) Platform](https://pulp-platform.org/projectinfo.html)
  RI5CY core, originally developed at ETH Zurich’s Integrated Systems
  Laboratory (IIS) and the Energy-efficient Embedded Systems (EEES) group of
  the University of [Bologna](https://dei.unibo.it/en/research). Digital
  integration and back-end design of the CORE-V MCU was handled by
  [QuickLogic](https://www.quicklogic.com/) and [CMC Microsystems](https://www.cmc.ca/), 
  respectively.
- The CORE-V MCU includes QuickLogic’s eFPGA, designed to accelerate AI/
  machine learning (ML) and other computationally intensive workloads from the
  CV32E40P processor.
- [Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) is leading OpenHW SW Task Group
  projects including GCC compiler tools for the CORE-V cores and MCU, while
  [Ashling](https://www.ashling.com/) has led the development of the CORE-V SDK
  based on the Eclipse IDE, OpenOCD for debug and example programs.
-	The CORE-V MCU DevKit PCB board design integrating the CORE-V MCU and
  expansion board for the demo were handled by AWS, using an [AWS IoT ExpressLink](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-expresslink/) 
  powered for secure cloud connectivity.
- [Espressif Systems](https://www.espressif.com/) – a leading IoT connectivity
  solution provider, supplied AWS IoT ExpressLink modules for the CORE-V DevKit
  PCB to provide AWS IoT connectivity.
