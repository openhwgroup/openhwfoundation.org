Heading to Embedded World 2023? Stop by the OpenHW Group & Eclipse Foundation
booth Hall 4 – 554. OpenHW Group will be highlighting their CORE-V Family of
Open Source RISC-V Cores for High Volume Production SoCs.

The CORE-V Family is a series of RISC-V based open-source cores with associated
processor subsystem IP, tools, and software for electronic system designers.
These cores can be used to facilitate rapid design innovation and ensure
effective manufacturability of production SoCs. OpenHW Group and members
including Ashling and Low Power Futures will be demonstrating several working
group projects at Embedded World. Live demos and theater presentations will be
conducted over the three-day event. Project highlights include the CORE-V MCU,
CORE-V Trusted MCU, CVA6 demo and future roadmap of the CORE-V Family

CORE-V cores are verified using CORE-V-VERIF a silicon-proven, industrial-grade
functional verification platform. CORE-V-VERIF leverages verification components
developed by the RISC-V community and will be continuously maintained and
enhanced to integrate the latest best-practices and technology for the
verification of future CORE-V cores for use in high-volume production SoCs.
