## Statement of Work for OpenHW Europe WG HW Verification Engineer

The Eclipse Foundation Europe GmbH is hiring for its OpenHW Europe Working
Group a HW Verification Engineer. Working as a member of the Eclipse Research
Team, and working closely with the OpenHW Technical Working Group, the
candidate will work to verify at industrial-grade open-source IPs based on
RISC-V.

Through the OpenHW Europe Working Group, we are recruiting for the role of HW
Verification Engineer that will primarily contribute to the TRISTAN project for
the next roughly 1.5 years. A follow up project is already planed. The TRISTAN
(**T**ogether for **RIS**c-V **T**echnology and **A**pplicatio**N**s) project
is a KDT-JU European Union-funded project that aims to expand, mature, and
industrialize the European RISC-V ecosystem for the next generation of
industrial hardware so that it is able to compete with existing
commercial/proprietary alternatives. The project will address SW to EDA tools,
all the way to RTL components, ensuring a complete stack based on
RISC-V.TRISTAN includes several work packages that will cover 1) requirements
collections of the European market needs; 2) development of industrial-grade
CPU and SoC building blocks; 3) software stacks; 4) and applications/demo
development.

A major focus for TRISTAN is to provide European digital sovereignty and
democratic access to most of the RISC-V IPs As such, a significant portion of
the developed IP blocks under TRISTAN will be released as open-source IPs.

The OpenHW Group ecosystem, and in particular, the OpenHW Europe Eclipse
Foundation Working Group, provides industrial-grade open-source IPs verified to
be compliant with a Technology Readiness Level greater than or equal to TRL5.

We are looking for a Hardware Verification Engineer that extends the OpenHW
Group ecosystem.

## In this role, you will:

- Use SystemVerilog and UVM to create and extend our testbenches: you should
  know how to verify IPs with random instructions
- Use GitHub to integrate and maintain everything open-source on GitHub under
  core-v-verif
- Verify CPUs based on RISC-V
- Verify peripherals such as UART, SPI, GPIOs, interrupt controllers, and
  interconnects
- Integrate and extend existing CPUs to support extra features
- Integrate and extend new co-processors
- Carrying out typical development tasks including dissemination, reporting,
  etc.
- Support the specific initiatives of the OpenHW Technical Working Group to
  drive interest, participation, and adoption beyond just the TRISTAN project
- Support the broader objectives of the Eclipse Foundation’s European research
  team, including:
    - Lead the activities of the Eclipse Foundation to support the European
      research ecosystem, more specifically in the OpenHW Europe working group
      activities
    - Initiate and organize dissemination and community-building activities for
      the projects, leveraging existing Eclipse Foundation initiatives and
      assets
    - Facilitate project participation at events such as conferences to benefit
      the projects
    - Enable dissemination through web assets, newsletters and Eclipse-related
      social media
    - Complete regular reporting (workload and expenses) as required by the EU
      processes
    - Support research project developers in working with the Eclipse
      Development Process (EDP) and open source and open hardware best
      practices
    - Represent the Eclipse Foundation and OpenHW Europe working group at
      research project meetings and reviews
    - Encourage synergies among the EU projects and Eclipse Foundation members
- Work fully remotely in a large and global team

## To accomplish the mission above, you should:

- Be very confident with SystemVerilog and UVM for use with coverage-driven,
  constrained-random verification strategies.
- A working knowledge of: 
    - Linux, Make, and Python
    - Computer architectures of general-purpose CPUs
    - Peripheral busses, interrupt controllers, and peripherals such as UART,
      SPI, and GPIOs
    - A commercial SystemVerilog simulator and associated debug and coverage
      tools
- Familiarity with Formal Verification, RTL design, RISC-V ISA, and Git would
  also be an asset

## Qualifications

- A Bachelor’s degree (or higher) in EE or CS with 5+ years of experience
- Fluent in English (spoken and written)
- You must be a resident of Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, or Germany
