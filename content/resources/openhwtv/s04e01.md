Security has become a critical issue for the entire IoT supply chain in recent
years, as the number of connected devices continues to grow and our reliance on
them increases. With more devices connected to the internet, the potential for
security breaches and data theft also increases. The following topics will be
discussed in this episode:

- Brief overview of the CORE-V Trusted MCU Project. (This project was developed
  to ensure there is an option for the very best security starting from the
  design phase on all OpenHW devices.)

- The complexity of IoT security

- The current vulnerabilities of hardware

- The benefits of having a root of trust or physical uncountable function (PUF)
  in your device

Featured presenters for this episode will include: Dr. Abdoulaye Berthe,
Founder & President of Low Power Futures and Chris Jones, Director of
Applications at Crypto Quantique. Rick O'Connor, President & CEO of OpenHW
Group, will host a live Q&A session at the end of the webinar.
