{{< youtube "UfZ3jbH6eM0" >}}

Our last webinar episode of 2020 is now available to watch on-demand. Last month we looked at our progress on the RTL functional freeze milestone for the CVE4 and how we arrived there with the high-quality verification work from our members. We had a lot of questions about the Formal Verification work carried out to get us this far, so we have dedicated this episode to a deep-dive into the Formal Verification work and to hear from our partners on what it actually means. As always, the panel session will be live for a Q&A with all our speakers.
