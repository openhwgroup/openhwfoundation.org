This episode of OpenHW TV focuses on the incredible journey of the open-source
RISC-V processor CVA6, from its inception as Ariane to its present state. The
discussion covers its current features, supported configurations (e.g.,
multicore) accelerators (e.g., RISC-V Vector), and platforms. 

Details of the ongoing design improvements and rigorous verification work will
be shared along with a demo of DOOM running on CVA6 (on an FPGA platform). 

Finally, we will discuss the future roadmap of CVA6 with multiple OpenHW Group
members. Featured Presenters: 

- Florian Zaruba, Axelera AI and OpenHW Group 
- Fatima Saleem, 10xEngineers 
- Jean-Roch Coulon, Thales
- SÃ©bastien Jacq, Thales 
- Flo Wohlrab, CEO of OpenHW Group, will host a live Q&A session at the end of
  this episode.
